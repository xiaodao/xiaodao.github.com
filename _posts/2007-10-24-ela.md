One year ago, 5 guys decided that we should have an official
association serving for the Ethosers, then almost every new Ethoser was
welcomed to join us, which made him/her be familiar with Ethos soon.
	
ELA was increasing very rapidly, even much faster that Ethos. And
several weeks later, we began to order the food at office, so that
everyone saved a lot of time which would have been wasted waiting for
the food at the restaurant. Then we offered 20% discount for the girl
members, and also persuaded one restaurant to give us 10% discount each
time.
	
Some new peoples joined ELA, and someone quit.
	
We played cards before lunch; we shared Zhang Xiaos duck.
	
We had a great deal happy time together, watching the growth of Ethos.
	
A lot of changes happened during the last six months, and for some
reason, ELA is paused for quite a long time, but I hope our beautiful
memories wont leave as the time passed.
	
We learned a lot as we are growing up, and lost a lot at the same time.
	
Thats exactly The Growing Pains.
