2days retreat ended.

It's supposed to be a happy time and it did make me, even almost all of us happy, but I'm still fell sad, like seeing leaves drop down from the trees in autumn.

I couldn't help missing the previous treat, when we were still around 40 person, and Fang Weitao, Deng Zhaoye didn't leave. It was a wonderful time, when we stayed in a single room, and we knew how is the company going, how is everyone doing.

I still remember the second afternoon in the previous retreat, that we had almost 2 hours free time, and some of us decided to climb the hills. I had never imagined that Deng could be as agile as a deer - it was impossible for we 4 boys to catch up with her, she disappeared from our sights quickly and she had to stop and wait for us every now and then.

To make things more interesting, we decided to find another way go back to the hotel, and finally climbed over 4 or 5 hills and broke a way from the thron bushes and trees.

But we will never be able to experience the passed time, and she will go to Hainan within this month. I miss her very much, and the happy time that the company experienced together.

The memory rushes on the strings of the lingering heart making the music of sadness.
