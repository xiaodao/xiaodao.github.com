The musics that found on Baidu can be separated into two categories: 

1) Baidu has copyrights.
2) Baidu doesn't have copyrights

For the second part, you can just use watir/selenium/webdriver to get the download address and download it with wget/curl, but for the first part, as the songs are located on Baidu website, then the read download links can only be retrieved with HTTP header, then only Mechanize gem can work on this situation.

You can put the song list into a file named "untitled.txt", one song per line. Then run the ruby script below.

You need to have "watir-webdriver", "mechanize" ruby gems and "curl" installed.

<pre>
<code>
require 'rubygems'
require 'watir-webdriver'
require 'mechanize'

def download(songname)
  return if(songname.nil?)
  browser = Watir::Browser.new :firefox
  search_song(browser, songname)
  song_link_xpath = "//table[@class='table-song-list']/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/a"
  song_link = browser.element_by_xpath(song_link_xpath)
  
  if((!song_link.exist?) || (!song_link.text.eql? songname))
    puts songname + " not found"
    browser.close
    return
  end
 
  puts songname + " found, prepare to download..."
  download_song song_link, songname, browser
  browser.close
end

def search_song(browser, song_name)
  browser.goto "http://mp3.baidu.com"
  browser.radio(:id, "Mp3").set
  browser.text_field(:id, "ww").set(song_name)
  browser.form(:name, "f1").submit
end

def download_song link, songname, browser
  if(!link.href.start_with? "http://mp3.baidu.com")
    download_none_copyright_song link, songname, browser
  else
    download_copyright_song link, songname
  end
end

def download_none_copyright_song link, songname, browser
  puts songname + " is not based on baidu"
  link.click
  browser.windows[1].use
  @song_link = browser.element_by_xpath("//div[@class='mu_r']/a")[0].href
  @songname = songname + ".mp3"
  system "curl #{@song_link} -o #{@songname}"
end

def download_copyright_song link, songname
  puts songname + " is based on baidu"
  
  agent = Mechanize.new
  download_link = agent.get(link.href).links[1]
  
  puts "starts to download file: " + songname + " ..."
  
  file = download_link.click
  file.save(songname+".mp3")
  
  puts songname + "download finished"
end

open("untitled.txt"){ |f|
  while line = f.gets
    songname = line.strip!
    download songname
  end
}
