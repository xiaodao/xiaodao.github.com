## As an iOS developer

### Telstra 24x7 app

With Tesltra 24x7 app([iphone](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/telstra-24x7-for-iphone/id543829966?mt=8),[ipad](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/telstra-24x7/id515891733?mt=8)), people can take control and manage their Telstra Personal services on the move - track call & estimated data usage usage, pay the bills, check credit and recharge. 

I've worked on this project for 6 months, did some exploration and practice on mobile app automated unit testing and acceptance testing with OCUnit/OCMock/OCHamcrest/Frank/Cucumber.

## As a Java developer

### [Telstra My Account](https://www.my.telstra.com.au/myaccount/home)

The project is to build the online service portal for Telstra. The client team is trying agile methodology but has little experience of how to implement the technical practices. I coached the client team with agile practices, such as continuous integration, test driven development, pair programming, automatic test, etc.

### [Biomed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/)

The project is to build the portal site and internal workflow system based on a ten-years legacy system. During the past 8 months, the team built up a steady delivery rhythm â€“ twice a month. At the end of each iteration, which is 2 weeks' long, the system would be deployed to the production environment.

I acted in the project as a senior developer. I did lots of work on improving delivery productivity, and also used Lean principles leading the team working in the way of self-improvement.

### [Qrodo](http://www.qrodo.com)

A client/server based Java project, which used XMPP (Jabber), Eclipse RCP (SWT & JFace), MySql, and also communicates with many devices, such as ZWave, Linksys, USB cameras. 

## As an agile coach

### Huawei agile enablement

The engagement was to provide agile/lean transformation for a delivery team with 120+ people, working on a huge legacy system with over 20,000,000 lines of code. In this consulting project, I helped the client to establish their continuous integration environment, and coached the client team with Scrum disciplines.

### Alcatel-Lucent lean organizational transformation

The engagement was to provide agile/lean transformation for a delivery team with 100+ people. I trained a lot of Scrum Masters and introduced Kanban method to the operation team, helped the team achieved higher productivity.

## My opensource projects

### [iRefactoring](https://github.com/xiaodao/iRefactoring) - ruby/rails

This project is inspired by the [article](http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&ObjectType=COL&ObjectId=16679&tth=DYN&tt=siteemail&iDyn=2) of Micheal Feather. By comparing the svn/git/hg commit log with code coverage report, people can easily tell which class has the highest priority to be refactored.

### [Beergame](https://github.com/gigix/beergame) - ruby/rails

The Beer Distribution Game (The Beer Game) is a simulation game created by a group of professors at MIT Sloan School of Management in early 1960s to demonstrate a number of key principles of supply chain management. The game is played by teams of at least four players, often in heated competition, and takes from one to one and a half hours to complete. A debriefing session of roughly equivalent length typically follows to review the results of each team and discuss the lessons involved.

### [psbuild](https://github.com/xiaodao/psbuild) - PowerShell

This goal of this project is to apply Powershell for environment configuration management on Windows Platform, user could use this suite of scripts to install software, install Windows updates, update IIS settings, install/uninstall Windows services, change firewall settings, etc.
