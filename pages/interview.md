* describe your experience

	I've been working for ThoughtWorks as an developer and agile coach for almost 4 years. My current project is Tesltra 24x7 apps - both for iPhone and iPad. I joined this iOS project around 6 months ago. Besides delivering the product, I also contributed a lot on improving the quality, like giving sessions on unit test, improving the code quality of automated functional test, setting up CI pipeline, and ensuring the CI discipline.

	As a Java developer, I worked on several legacy systems, and Biomed Central is one of them. Biomed Central is the biggest open access publisher in UK. It publishes journal on biology, medicine, chemistry, etc. It had a large code base with a very very poor test coverage and the code is tightly coupled, logic is scattered everywhere: java code, store procedure and Oracle trigger. I suppose you can imagine how difficult it is to find the right place to add or change a function. I worked on this project for 1 and a half year. We setup a big test pyramid for the system.
